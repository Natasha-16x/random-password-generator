## Description 
This is an app that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS, all powered by JavaScript code that I have written. The functionality of this website, is to generate a random password after collating user inputs through a series of prompts for password preferences. The password has specific criteria that it has to meet which are: having a password length of 10-64 character and include special, numeric, lowercase and uppercase characters.
